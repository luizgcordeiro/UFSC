    Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.

    Sorting: Adding a new name to a sorted name list (new student, for example)
    Convex hull: Building a fence that goes arround certain trees

    Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world setting?

    Cost, precision, ease-of-use.
*/

/*
    1.1-3
    Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengthsand limitations.

    Linked lists: Easy to add a new element in the middle. Expensive to access n-th element.

    1.1-4
    How are the shortest-path and the traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?

    They both ask to find shortest paths in a graph with certain properties. The shortest-path problem requires
    to find a path that connects two points, but which is short. The traveling-salesman problem asks for a path starting
    and ending at the same point but which goes through a bunch of other pointes, so it is "long, but not too long".+

    1.1.5
    Come up with a real world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with
    one in which a solution that is "approximately" the best is good enough.

    Only best: Find someone's phone number.
    Approximately best: Routing.
